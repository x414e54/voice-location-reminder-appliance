An example would be:

Speaking to a device:

"Tell my kettle to switch on when [Contact](Contact.md) gets within 5 minutes of my house... then remind me to put the tea bag in and let it brew after the kettle is boiled and then remind me to take it out after 2 minutes".

When the contact got within 5minutes or a certain radius of the speakers house the device would communicate to a networked kettle or other appliance and switch it on. This could use current reminder systems and also voice recognition systems.

The kettle could be using a simple 6LoWPAN or Bluetooth 4 network system, and be known to the device (e.g. android phone).
